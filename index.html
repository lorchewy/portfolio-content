		<p>It is a common myth that every story needs a hero. Listeners need a hero, like sheeps need a dog,
			to show them what they are capable of, what they can achieve, what they can and cannot be.
			The truth is not all stories need a hero. Heroes make stories interesting, but they are not 
			what drives the story. It is the villain that makes a story worth telling.
			It is the villain who sets the world in motion; the hero is simply a reactor. 
			All story worth telling have a good villain. Villains make story real. If we read books
			and watch television to see ourselves as the heros, then who do we see as the villians in the real world?
		</p>
		<div>Every hero has a song. A song to celebrate their story and triumph. 
			What about the bad guys? SongsforVillians is a platform determined to
			find songs for the bad guy. SongsforVillians is currently featuring villains from two animes: the Akatsuki from Naruto 
			and the Espada from Bleach. </div> 
			
		<p>Naruto is an anime set in the shinobi (ninja) world. The story follows our protagonist Naruto,
			a dense loser who dreams of becoming Hokage (the strongest ninja in the Leaf Village). Naruto is a good hero archetype because
			the world is set against him. He is an orphan and everyone in his village hates him (correctly so) because he carries a monster inside of him.
			For more information on Naruto, go to your local library, or just read the <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto#searchInput> wikipedia page.</a> </p>

		<p>Bleach is set in a world where spirits, who cannot reincarnate, becomes vicious monsters (Hollows). 
			Shinigamis (soul reapers) carries out the duty of killing Hollows to maintain peace between the spirit 
			realm and the human world. Bleach folllows Ichigo, a 'normal' high school student, who becomes a Shinigami through a ritual.
			Ichigo, later, turns out to be descended from Shinigamis (his mother married a soul reaper). 
			Ichigo (surprisingly) is everything and nothing at once. For more information on Bleach, see the <a href = https://bleach.fandom.com/wiki/Bleach_Wiki> fandom page.</a>
