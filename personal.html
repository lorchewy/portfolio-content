	<p>Hello and thanks for visiting! My name is Chewy Lor, and this is my first webpage. 
		This website is created with html and css. 
		This is purely for comedy purposes (plus my grade). 
		Bleach and Naruto were two of my favorite shows as a teenager. 
		I do not watch much anime anymore, but I still love the villians from these two shows.
		This project combines two of my favorite things: music and bad guys. 
	</p>
	<p>P.S. This is a joke. Please tell me, I am funny. I put all my worth on my ability to entertain people. If you enjoy this website,
		and would like to recommend a song or villian, please do share. I am always excited to talk about villians.
