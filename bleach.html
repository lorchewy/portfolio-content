	<p id="summary">In Bleach, Hollows evolve as they consume souls. 
		The Espada are a group of humanoid Hollows from the underworld. They are the peak evolution of Hollows.
		They are the bad guys who wants to take over the human world.</p>
	<div class="container">
		<img src = "images/yammy_llargo.jpeg" alt="A bald burly brown-skinned man with orange eyebrows. He wears a jawbone for a mask." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada0song.jpg" alt="A group of masked white men in a field of tall grass." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Yammy, the aspect of rage, is both Espada #10 and #0 depending on how his anger level. Slipknot's 'Psychosoial' is one of the angriest song out there.</p>

		<img src = "images/coyote_and_lilynette.jpeg" alt="Two bonded spirits qurrelling: one is a man with wavy brown hair and the other is a teenager girl with green hair and skull mask." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada1song.jpg" alt="A young person in 80s clothes leans back against a lamp post." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Coyote and Lilnette are the aspect of loneliness. They cannot bare to be separated even though they're already dead. 'People I Been Sad' is a perfect match for the unbearableness of losing someone.</p>

		<img src = "images/king_baraggan.jpeg" alt="Old man with a scar running down his right eye. He wears a crown made of bones." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada2song.jpg" alt="Rainbow Kitten Suprise's first album cover." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Baraggan is the aspect of age. He is literally the devil, but even the devil cannot fight the plot armor king. 'Devil Like me' matches the vibe of a sad devil.</p>

		<img src = "images/nelliel.jpeg" alt="A woman with turquoise hair and brown eyes. She wears a cracked goat skull." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/nelsong.jpg" alt="Jai Paul's first album cover: A large 'X' background." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Nelliel is the exiled Espada #3. Jai Paul's 'BTSTU' is about returning to the motherland and reclaiming your throne, I think.</p>
		
		<img src = "images/tier.jpeg" alt="A tan-skinned woman with blond hair. She wears a face mask of shark teeth." tabindex="+1"/>
        <img src = "images/espada3song.jpg" alt="Rina Sawayama's first album cover: a Japanese woman with hair tied up like window curtains but fashionable." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Tier, the aspect of sacrifice, is the king of the Underworld, and who does it better than Rina Sawayama's 'Comme Des Garcons'?</p>

		<img src = "images/ulquiorra.jpeg" alt="A young gray-skinned man wearing a half-skull mask in the shape of a bat." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada4song.jpg" alt="David Bowie's 'Life on Mars' album cover: a skinny white man looking upward." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Ulquiorra is all about sadness and existentialism. David Bowie's 'Life on Mars' is about existentialism without the sadness, the struggle of a middle-class life!</p>

		<img src = "images/nnoitra.jpeg" alt="A tall lanky man with a wide smile, black hair, and piercing eyes." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada5song.jpg" alt="Joji's first album cover: a drunk japanese man smiling, head tilted." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Nnoitra is the aspect of despair, but the show doesn't explore that. All he wants is attention. I think he would love Joji's 'Attention,' an unofficial simp anthem.</p>

		<img src = "images/grimmjow.jpeg" alt="Handsome young man with blue hair, eye eyes, and turquoise eyeshadow." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada6song.jpg" alt="Maneskin's album cover: 4 young Italian teenagers stand in front of a hill." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Grimmjow loves destorying things, and he can destory me anytime. A real bad boy deserves a real bad song: Maneskin's 'I Want to be Your Slave.'</p>

		<img src = "images/luppi.jpeg" alt="A young feminine man with purple eyes, black bob, and diamonds tattooed above his left brow." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/luppisong.jpg" alt="Amaarae's first album cover: a collection of melting bodies in the sky." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Luppi was in the show for two second. I think he would love Amaarae's 'SAD GIRLZ LUV MONEY,' because he seems like a party girl. </p>

		<img src = "images/zommari.jpeg" alt="A balded dark-skinned man with golden eyes. He wears a necklace of animal teeth." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada7song.jpg" alt="Black Sabbath's 'Master of Reality' album cover: all text on a black background." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>This man can make clones of himself, being in two places at once, and control others' movement, yet plot armor got another reality stored for him. Black Sabbath's 'Master of Reality' Zommari suits his story and beliefs.</p>
		
		<img src = "images/szayelaporro.jpeg" alt="A man with pink hair, bright amber eyes, and white glasses. " tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada8song.jpg" alt="A distraught woman with lip stick rubbed all over her face. "tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Szayelaporro is the aspect of madness. You have to be mad to be in love with a serial killer. Moncrieff - Serial Killer.</p>

		<img src = "images/aaroniero.jpeg" alt="A human-like spirit with a head shaped like a spear. It wears an elongated mask with eight holes." tabindex="+1"/>
		<img src = "images/espada9song.jpg" alt="Nina Simone's 'I put a spell on you' album cover." tabindex="+1"/>
		<p>Aaroniero is the aspect of greed. By absorbing anyone's spirit, Aaroniero can transform into them, thus putting a spell onto their next victim. Nina Simone - I put a spell on you.</p>
