	<p id="summary">Akatsuki is a group of rouge ninjas. They were some of the best ninjas from their respective villages.
		The Akatsuki's mission is world peace. They aim to achieve this goal by putting the entire world 
		under an illusion spell. The Akatsuki's signature colors are black and red, whose inspiration is visible on this website.</p>

		<img src = "images/konan.jpeg" alt="A woman with purple hair, labret piercing, and an origami rose hairpin." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/konansong.jpg" alt="mitski's fifth album cover: a woman facing up, eyes closed while lighting strikes around her. "/>
		<p>Konan exists to protect Nagato, and then he died, like all her friends. To want to be the "Only Heartbreaker" is to not be heartbrokened. Song by the one and only mitski.</p>

		<img src = "images/deidara.jpeg" alt="A pale-skinned man with long blond hair in half ponytail and half bangs." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/Dierdasong.jpg" alt="AC/DC's album cover: a man playing a guitar while being struck by lighting."/>
		<p>Deidara's art is explosive, literally. He died doing what he loved, exploding himself. His life would be epic if paired with AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck.'</p>

		<img src = "images/hidan.jpeg" alt="A tall man with slicked back grey hair and purple eyes." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/hidansong.jpeg" alt="Leonard Cohen's album cover: a man in a black suit with a cigerette."/>
		<p>Hidan's a religious guy who cannot died but is buried in the dark. If someone ever digs him up, his comeback song should be Leonard Cohen's 'You Want it Darker.'</p>
		
		<img src = "images/itachi.jpeg" alt="A pale tall man with jet black eyes and parted bangs." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/temple.jpeg" alt="Thao's album cover: an Asian woman stand in the center of a halo of words."/>
		<p>Itachi is so sad. He deserves a good song like Thao's 'Temple.' What is war but brothers killing each other?</p>

		<img src = "images/kakuzu.jpeg" alt="A masked tan-skinned man with bright green irides and no pupil." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/kakuzusong.png" alt="Billie Eillish's album cover: a young woman with white eyes sitting on a bed."/>
		<p>Kakuzu is a monster with monsters inside of him. Those monsters are his only friends, even though they became monsters because he killed them.
			A fitting song is 'Bury a Friend' by Billie Eillish.</p>

		<img src = "images/kisame.jpeg" alt="A grey-skinned man with shark-like facial features: small bulbous eyes and gills on his cheekbones." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/kisamesong.jpg" alt="Queen's album cover: a giant robot holding a woman in its hand."/>
		<p>Kisame loves killing things. I think he would listen to Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now," as he kills people.</p>

		<img src = "images/nagato.jpeg" alt="A man with short spiky auburn hair, labret piercing and three bridge piercings." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/nagatosong.jpg" alt="Rage Against the Machine's album cover: a monk on fire."/>
		<p>Nagato is violence for the greater good like Rage Against the Machine using a monk on fire to make a political statement. Song:'Killing in the name.'</p>

		<img src = "images/orochimaru.jpeg" alt="A man with snake-like facial features: slitted pupils, paper-white skin, and long black hair." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/orochimarusong.jpg" alt="Nicki Minaj's album cover: a black-asian woman sitting against a blue background."/>
		<p>Orochimaru used to be a good guy, turned bad guy, and then good guy. He needs to pick a side! He was the real bad guy before all the bad guys like Nicki in 'Chun-li.'</p>

		<img src = "images/sasori.jpeg" alt="A youthful man with red hair and brown sleepy eyes." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/sasorisong.jpg" alt="Seinabo Sey's album cover: A young black woman posted against a red background."/>
		<p>Sasori got killed by his grandmother, which he deserved (he's so hot!). Seinabo Sey's 'Pistol at Dawm' is a perfect manifestion of the tension between
			a grandson dualing with his teacher/grandmother.</p>

		<img src = "images/tobi.jpeg" alt="A man in a orange-swirl patterned mask with only one eye opening. " width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/tobisong.jpg" alt="Foster The People's album cover: a cartoon rendering of three men dancing."/>
		<p>Tobi is pretty cool as an adult, but he struggled as a kid. If Tobi was a millenial, he would have Foster the People's "Pumped Up Kicks" on his ipod shuffle.</p>
		
		<img src = "images/zetsu.jpeg" alt="A man with green hair whose body is divided into two: one half white, other half black." width="200"/>
		<img src = "images/zetsusong.jpg" alt="White Town's album cover: title of band name in green set against a white background."/>
		<p>I don't understand what Zetsu is, but he is not enough. I think he would like White Town's 'Your Woman.'</p>
